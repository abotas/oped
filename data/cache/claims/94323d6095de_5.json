    "claim": "Human cognition is not equivalent to computation; because the human mind integrates conscious and unconscious processes, emotions, embodied wisdom, moral sentiments, agency, and unique lived experience, AI\u2014which lacks consciousness, self-awareness, emotions, and a personal worldview\u2014cannot replicate it."

    "claim": "AI is a narrower, different kind of intelligence that excels at pattern synthesis and correlations but struggles with causality, narrative reasoning, and temporal understanding, in part because it only accesses conscious language rather than embodied or implicit knowledge."

    "claim": "In the near term, AI will act as an ally that boosts productivity and democratizes access to expertise and education worldwide\u2014e.g., tutoring, drafting routine communications, and disproportionately helping less-skilled users\u2014with early evidence such as a 2023 Harvard Business School/Boston Consulting Group study showing consultants produced 40% higher-quality work when using AI."

    "claim": "Although bad actors will misuse AI, most people will use it for learning and innovation, leading to net positive outcomes (including medical advances), and AI\u2019s ultimate effect will be to highlight human distinctiveness and encourage greater emphasis on caregiving, teamwork, deep reading, exploration, spirituality, and enjoyment."
