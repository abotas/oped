  "claim": "By around 2035, individuals worldwide should be able to marshal 'unlimited genius'\u2014effectively the cumulative intellectual capacity equivalent to everyone in 2025\u2014making single people more, not less, impactful in the AGI era.",

  "explanation": "This is a speculative, extreme prediction not supported by current evidence. Large expert surveys put the median 50% chance for human-level AI around 2047\u2014not ~2035\u2014and emphasize wide uncertainty. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02843?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Physical bottlenecks also challenge the idea of \u201cunlimited genius\u201d: analyses forecast high\u2011quality human text for training could be effectively exhausted between about 2026 and 2032, and the IEA projects data\u2011centre electricity demand merely doubling by 2030 and, in a high\u2011adoption scenario, rising to ~1,700 TWh by 2035\u2014large, but hardly indicative of limitless, universally accessible capability.

([itu.int](https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/Pages/PR-2024-11-27-facts-and-figures.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Overall, the claim overreaches both timeline and feasibility.",
