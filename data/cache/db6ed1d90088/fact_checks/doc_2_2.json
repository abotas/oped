  "claim": "Advanced AI already multiplies scientific productivity (often 2\u20133\u00d7), and using AI to build better AI constitutes an early form of recursive self-improvement that could compress a decade of research into a year or even a month.",

  "explanation": "Evidence to date shows AI boosts productivity on specific research-related tasks, but typical gains are tens of percent, not \u201coften 2\u20133\u00d7\u201d: RCTs report 14% for customer support, ~40% faster professional writing, ~21% faster complex engineering tasks, and 56% faster on a single coding task.

([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17866?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) AI is used to help build better AI (e.g., AlphaDev, self-refinement/distillation), yet claims that such \u201crecursive self\u2011improvement\u201d can compress a decade of research into a year or month remain speculative and unvalidated; prominent analyses urge caution.
