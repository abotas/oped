  "claim": "Ambitious but plausible economic development outcomes for low- and middle-income countries include sustained double-digit growth\u2014aspirationally ~20% annual GDP (10% from AI-guided policy and 10% from technology diffusion)\u2014alongside advances in food security and climate mitigation, contingent on overcoming corruption and policy adoption barriers.",
  "veracity": 20,
  "explanation": "Sustained national GDP growth near 20% annually is essentially unprecedented; even double\u2011digit episodes are rare and typically short\u2011lived, with China an outlier and Ethiopia\u2019s widely noted boom averaging ~10.9% over 2004\u20132014. ([library.hbs.edu](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/the-curse-of-double-digit-growth), [worldbank.org](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/11/23/wbethiopia-a-unique-economic-strategy-delivering-high-growth?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Credible estimates of AI\u2019s macro impact are far below 10 percentage points per year: OECD finds AI could add roughly 0.4\u20131.3 pp to annual labour\u2011productivity growth (over a decade), and Goldman Sachs frames AI\u2019s effect mainly as a cumulative level boost (~10\u201315% globally over the long run), not 10% yearly growth. ([oecd.org](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/macroeconomic-productivity-gains-from-artificial-intelligence-in-g7-economies_a5319ab5-en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [gspublishing.com](https://www.gspublishing.com/content/research/en/reports/2023/10/30/2d567ebf-0e7d-4769-8f01-7c62e894a779.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Technology diffusion does support catch\u2011up but typically occurs gradually and depends on human capital, openness and governance\u2014again inconsistent with 10 pp annual gains. ([newyorkfed.org](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr169.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The conditional part of the claim is more plausible: corruption and weak policy capacity impede growth, food security and climate action, as IMF, FAO and IPCC emphasize.
