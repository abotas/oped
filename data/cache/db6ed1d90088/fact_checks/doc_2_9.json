  "claim": "Public policy worldwide should co-evolve with AI and trend toward individual empowerment (more user control and some open-sourcing within broad societal bounds) to avoid the alternative of authoritarian misuse such as mass surveillance and loss of autonomy.",
  "veracity": 50,
  "explanation": "The statement is a normative policy opinion (a \u201cshould\u201d), so it isn\u2019t a verifiable factual claim. Its premise\u2014that AI can be misused for authoritarian ends such as mass surveillance\u2014is well documented (e.g., global trends in digital repression and concrete cases like Xinjiang).
