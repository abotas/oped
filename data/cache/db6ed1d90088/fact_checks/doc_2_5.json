  "claim": "AI agents will act as junior virtual coworkers across knowledge work; for software, an agent can handle most tasks of a top-company engineer with a few years\u2019 experience (for multi-day tasks) under human supervision, and can be replicated at scales from thousands to millions globally.",
  "veracity": 45,
  "explanation": "Partly true in direction, but overstated for software today. Evidence shows AI agents already act as junior \u201cvirtual coworkers\u201d in some knowledge work at large scale (e.g., Klarna\u2019s AI assistant handled two\u2011thirds of customer\u2011service chats, doing the work of ~700 agents), and enterprise copilots/agents are widely deployed. ([klarna.com](https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) For software engineering, however, current best public evaluations don\u2019t support the claim that an agent can handle \u201cmost tasks\u201d of a top\u2011company engineer on multi\u2011day work: on SWE\u2011bench Verified, leading systems are roughly in the 65\u201372% range on curated issues, and the benchmark\u2019s verified set skews toward tasks under an hour for a human engineer. ([swebench.com](https://www.swebench.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-swe-bench-verified/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Long\u2011horizon, multi\u2011step reliability remains a problem\u2014errors compound over steps and agents struggle on extended planning tasks. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-agents-errors-hallucinations-compound-risk-2025-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06318?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Even where \u201ccoding agents\u201d exist (e.g., GitHub Copilot coding agent), they are in public preview, positioned for low\u2011to\u2011medium complexity tasks, and require human review\u2014far from autonomously handling most multi\u2011day engineering tasks. ([github.blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-19-github-copilot-coding-agent-in-public-preview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Replication to thousands\u2011to\u2011millions is feasible and happening (e.g., GitHub Copilot has 20M all\u2011time users; Microsoft says nearly 70% of the Fortune 500 use Microsoft 365 Copilot), but that scale reflects assistant/collaboration tools, not agents that can do most work of experienced engineers unsupervised.
