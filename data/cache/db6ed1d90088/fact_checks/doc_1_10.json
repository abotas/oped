  "claim": "If democracies secure AI leadership, they can use AI to counter authoritarian propaganda, expand uncensorable information access, improve legal impartiality and transparency, build consensus among citizens, and dramatically improve public-service delivery, thereby strengthening rule-of-law and democratic legitimacy.",
  "veracity": 60,
  "explanation": "Partly accurate but aspirational. Democracies already use AI to detect and disrupt influence operations and to prebunk/manually inoculate against propaganda, though real\u2011world deepfake detection still underperforms, limiting effectiveness. ([about.fb.com](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/march-2021-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06205?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [time.com](https://time.com/6970488/google-jigsaw-eu-elections-misinformation-prebunking/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) AI techniques have been shown to help evade state censors (e.g., Geneva\u2019s genetic\u2011algorithm strategies against China, Iran, Kazakhstan), potentially expanding access to blocked information. ([geneva.cs.umd.edu](https://geneva.cs.umd.edu/about/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [umdrightnow.umd.edu](https://umdrightnow.umd.edu/new-artificial-intelligence-system-automatically-evolves-evade-internet-censorship?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) In justice systems, European guidance notes AI can improve efficiency and transparency if used under principles of non\u2011discrimination and user control, but this remains contingent on safeguards. ([coe.int](https://www.coe.int/en/web/cepej/ethical-charter-on-ai1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Machine\u2011assisted consensus building has real\u2011world precedents (e.g., Taiwan\u2019s vTaiwan/Pol.is surfacing common ground used in policy). ([wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/how-taiwans-unlikely-digital-minister-hacked-the-pandemic?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Public\u2011sector AI is associated with more responsive services, and trust research links reliable, fair service delivery to higher institutional trust, supporting potential legitimacy gains. ([oecd.org](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_26324bc2-en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) However, AI also amplifies authoritarian censorship and disinformation, so net effects on rule\u2011of\u2011law and democratic legitimacy are uncertain.
