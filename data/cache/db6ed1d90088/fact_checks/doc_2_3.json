  "veracity": 40,
  "explanation": "Parts of the claim are grounded\u2014hyperscalers are pouring record sums into AI data centers in 2025 (e.g., Alphabet lifting capex guidance to ~$85B; Amazon toward ~$100B), and energy agencies project strong growth in data\u2011center electricity demand as AI workloads expand. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/alphabet-expects-to-invest-about-75-billion-in-capex-in-2025.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Robots do build robots at some plants (e.g., ABB\u2019s Shanghai \u2018robots make robots\u2019 facility; long\u2011running FANUC lights\u2011out production), though this is not yet ubiquitous across infrastructure construction. ([new.abb.com](https://new.abb.com/news/detail/115698/a-vision-of-the-future-at-abbs-robotics-mega-factory-in-shanghai?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-10-18/this-company-s-robots-are-making-everything-and-reshaping-the-world?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) However, the stronger assertion\u2014that the marginal cost of \u201cintelligence\u201d will converge to the price of electricity globally\u2014remains speculative: analyses show hardware acquisition/depreciation and other infrastructure dominate AI costs, with energy a minority share today, and industry commentary stresses AI\u2019s ongoing high marginal and capital costs. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.21015v2?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/ai-boom-is-infrastructure-masquerading-software-2025-07-23/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) While prominent figures (e.g., Sam Altman) predict a shift toward energy\u2011limited AI, current evidence does not show per\u2011inference costs approaching electricity alone, nor does it account for wide global power\u2011price and capacity constraints. ([time.com](https://time.com/7294803/ai-revolution-energy-revolution/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-2025/executive-summary?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) In short: the flywheel (value \u2192 compute buildout) is real, but the sweeping, global cost\u2011convergence claim is not yet supported.",
