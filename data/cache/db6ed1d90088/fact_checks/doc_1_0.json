  "claim": "In the 5\u201310 years after the arrival of powerful AI (which could be as early as 2026), AI could compress 50\u2013100 years of progress in biology and medicine into that period by acting as virtual biologists who design, run, and iterate real-world experiments, not merely analyze data.",

  "explanation": "Speculation, not evidence. Today\u2019s best systems can accelerate parts of biology and chemistry (e.g., AlphaFold 3 predicts many biomolecular interactions, and LLM/robotic \"self\u2011driving lab\" demos can plan and run some experiments), but they still require human oversight and experimental validation and are far from reliably autonomous \"virtual biologists.\" ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w?error=cookies_not_supported&error=cookies_not_supported&utm_source=chatgpt.com), [chemistryworld.com](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/first-gpt-4-powered-ai-lab-assistant-independently-directs-key-organic-reactions/4018723.article/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17631?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Authoritative reviews and assessments emphasize that fully autonomous discovery in biology is \u201ca long way off\u201d and that data fragmentation, infrastructure, and adoption hurdles remain.
