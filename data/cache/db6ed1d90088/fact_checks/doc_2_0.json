  "explanation": "Parts of the claim reflect reality\u2014AI capabilities and adoption have surged, with the 2025 AI Index reporting 78% of companies using AI in 2024 alongside major benchmark gains and large investment\u2014so many breakthroughs do diffuse into products.

([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02843?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [wiki.aiimpacts.org](https://wiki.aiimpacts.org/ai_timelines/predictions_of_human-level_ai_timelines/ai_timeline_surveys/2023_expert_survey_on_progress_in_ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Reputable sources also stress that AGI/superintelligence remain theoretical and poorly defined today. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/09/its-missing-something-agi-superintelligence-and-a-race-for-the-future?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Moreover, normalization is not \u201cworldwide\u201d: usage and benefits are uneven\u2014low\u2011income countries account for <1% of GenAI traffic, and OECD/IMF analyses project or observe widening regional divides in exposure and capability.

([newyorker.com](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/open-questions/what-if-ai-doesnt-get-much-better-than-this?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Overall, the statement mixes solid facts about rapid progress with speculative, contested assertions about a present \u201cgentle singularity,\u201d near-term superintelligence, and global ubiquity.",
