  "claim": "AI-driven biomedical science can shrink clinical development timelines to roughly a year for many interventions when effect sizes are large, and improved preclinical models/simulations can reduce iteration in human trials, enabling extensive parallelization.",
  "veracity": 25,
  "explanation": "Evidence does not support that AI can shrink clinical development to ~1 year for many interventions. Across 405 FDA approvals (2010\u20132020), median time from first\u2011in\u2011human to approval was 8.3 years; even with expedited pathways, oncology programs typically took ~4.5\u20136.7 years. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9869766/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) COVID\u201119 vaccines reached EUA in ~10\u201311 months only under exceptional pandemic conditions with overlapping phases and at\u2011risk manufacturing, which is not generalizable. ([gao.gov](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-319?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) As of 2025, no AI\u2011discovered drugs have been approved, so there\u2019s no empirical basis that AI routinely compresses clinical development to ~1 year.
