  "claim": "A near-term global timeline is forecast: 2025 brings agents capable of real cognitive work (e.g., coding), 2026 likely yields systems that can generate novel insights, and by 2027 robots may competently perform tasks in the physical world.",
  "veracity": 70,
  "explanation": "Mixed. The 2025 claim is supported: agentic coding systems already solve nontrivial software tasks (e.g., strong results on SWE-bench Verified and related leaderboards; OpenAI\u2019s o3 emphasizes autonomous coding/scaffolding performance). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-swe-bench-verified/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [swe-rebench.com](https://swe-rebench.com/leaderboard?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The 2026 \u201cnovel insights\u201d claim is conservative\u2014AI systems have already produced original scientific/technical results, such as AlphaTensor\u2019s new matrix-multiplication algorithms, AlphaDev\u2019s faster sorting/hashing, and GNoME\u2019s discovery of hundreds of thousands of stable materials. ([deepmind.google](https://deepmind.google/blog/discovering-novel-algorithms-with-alphatensor?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The 2027 robotics claim is the most uncertain: while pilots of humanoids/industrial robots are underway, experts note persistent hardware, battery, manufacturability, and scaling hurdles, making broad competence by 2027 speculative; broader expert timelines for human-level capabilities also skew later.
