  "claim": "Within a decade of powerful AI, global health outcomes could include near-elimination of natural infectious diseases, ~95% reductions in cancer incidence and mortality, effective cures or prevention for most genetic diseases, prevention (but limited reversal) of Alzheimer\u2019s, broad improvements across common chronic conditions, expanded 'biological freedom,' and a plausible doubling of healthy human lifespan toward ~150 years.",
  "veracity": 10,
  "explanation": "Extraordinary, near-term claims across many domains conflict with current evidence. Only one human infectious disease (smallpox) has ever been eradicated; wild poliovirus remains a PHEIC with continued transmission, and measles, TB and malaria burdens have recently surged\u2014far from \u201cnear\u2011elimination\u201d in a decade. ([who.int](https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/smallpox/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) A 95% drop in cancer incidence and mortality in 10 years is not credible: US cancer mortality has fallen about 34% over three decades, while WHO projects global cancer cases to rise markedly toward 2050. ([acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21871?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [who.int](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-02-2024-global-cancer-burden-growing--amidst-mounting-need-for-services?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Gene-editing has achieved landmark approvals (e.g., CRISPR-based therapy for sickle cell), but there are >10,000 rare diseases with <5% having approved treatments, and in\u2011vivo delivery remains a central bottleneck\u2014making cures or prevention for \u201cmost\u201d genetic diseases within a decade unlikely. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10913280/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [rarediseases.info.nih.gov](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/about-gard/pages/23/about-gard%26TOPIC_ID%3D4787?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adfm.202402630?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) For Alzheimer\u2019s, newly approved anti\u2011amyloid drugs slow decline (about 22\u201335% over 18 months) but neither prevent nor reverse the disease. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-kisunlatm-donanemab-azbt-approved-fda-treatment-early?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/07/2700886/0/en/FDA-Grants-Traditional-Approval-for-LEQEMBI-lecanemab-irmb-for-the-Treatment-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) While AI shows promise, rigorous clinical trials and national evaluations still find limited, heterogeneous evidence of broad, patient\u2011outcome gains at scale to date. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35904087/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [integratedcarejournal.com](https://integratedcarejournal.com/evaluation-of-nhs-artificial-intelligence-lab-identifies-lessons-to-shape-ais-future-in-health-and-care/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Finally, a plausible doubling of healthy human lifespan to ~150 years in the next decade has no empirical basis; the verified record remains 122 years and leading analyses suggest a practical ceiling near 115\u2013122, with no sign of approaching 150 soon.
