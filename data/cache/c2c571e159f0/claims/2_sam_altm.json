    "claim": "Three economic observations underpin rapid AI impact: model intelligence scales roughly with the log of resources (compute, data, inference), the cost to use a given level of AI has been falling ~10x per year (driving vastly more use), and linear increases in intelligence produce super\u2011exponential socioeconomic value, so continued heavy investment is likely."
