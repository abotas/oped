  "claim": "Common sceptical arguments (e.g., \u201cAIs just predict the next word\u201d, \u201cAIs cannot have true intelligence\u201d or that AGI is centuries away) are misleading because what matters for x-risk is demonstrated capabilities and intentions, and empirical capability trends through 2024 make AGI/ASI plausible within uncertain but potentially short timeframes.",

  "explanation": "Mostly true. The \u2018\u2018just predicting the next word\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018never true intelligence / centuries away\u2019\u2019 reframings are widely judged misleading because modern large models exhibit emergent reasoning, tool use and benchmark-level performance that go beyond simple memorized autocomplete (e.g., chain\u2011of\u2011thought and other reasoning results; GPT\u20114\u2019s benchmark performance). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Empirical inputs that matter for x\u2011risk\u2014demonstrated capabilities, compute-and\u2011data trends, and actors\u2019 stated intentions\u2014did accelerate through 2024 (training\u2011compute growth and model scale rising rapidly; large expert surveys assign non\u2011negligible short\u2011to\u2011midterm probabilities), which makes near\u2011term AGI/ASI plausible within wide uncertainty bounds. ([epoch.ai](https://epoch.ai/data-insights/compute-trend-post-2010?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02843?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) However, substantial disagreement and deep uncertainty remain (some analyses find low short\u2011term probabilities and many experts caution against precise dates), so the claim should not be taken as a certainty\u2014rather as a well\u2011supported, evidence\u2011based position with important residual uncertainty.
