  "claim": "The primary reason to focus on AI risks is instrumental: the technical and policy actions we take can substantially change the likelihood that the radically positive future materializes, whereas many of the basic benefits of AI development are driven by powerful market forces and may be inevitable unless risks derail them.",
  "veracity": 70,
  "explanation": "Partly true. Leading AI\u2011safety voices and organisations frame the case instrumentally: technical and policy interventions can materially change whether powerful AI produces a radically good or bad long\u2011run outcome (e.g., Bostrom; Stuart Russell; Paul Christiano; OpenAI\u2019s safety framing). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence%3A_Paths%2C_Dangers%2C_Strategies?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [humancompatible.ai](https://humancompatible.ai/blog/2023/09/11/ai-regulation-stuart-russells-opening-statement-at-u-s-senate-hearing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [paulfchristiano.com](https://paulfchristiano.com/ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [openai.com](https://openai.com/safety/how-we-think-about-safety-alignment/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Economic and market forces are also driving rapid AI deployment and large baseline benefits (McKinsey\u2019s trillion\u2011dollar estimates), which supports the claim that many basic benefits are propelled by markets. ([mckinsey.com](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/The-economic-potential-of-generative-AI-The-next-productivity-frontier?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) However, those benefits are not strictly \u201cinevitable\u201d: economists document implementation lags, required complementary investments, and distributional/governance barriers that can prevent or delay benefits (the productivity J\u2011curve), so policy/technical action still matters both to enable benefits and to prevent harms. ([mitsloan.mit.edu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/productivity-paradox-ai-adoption-manufacturing-firms?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Overall the instrumental characterization is a well\u2011supported and important reason to focus on AI risks, but it is an incomplete account (hence a high but not perfect score).",
