  "claim": "Specific near\u2011term technical milestones are plausible: 2025 will see AI agents performing real cognitive work and transforming software development, 2026 will likely produce systems that can generate novel scientific insights, and 2027 may bring robots capable of real\u2011world tasks, with much larger societal changes unfolding through the 2030s.",
  "veracity": 72,
  "explanation": "Plausible but partly optimistic. Agentic AIs are already doing substantial cognitive work in software development today (measured productivity gains from GitHub Copilot and multi\u2011agent/code\u2011automation research), so 2025 seeing agents reshape development is well supported. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06590?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [github.blog](https://github.blog/2023-06-27-the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) AI has already produced novel scientific advances (AlphaFold, ML\u2011discovered antibiotics) and LLMs have generated lab\u2011validated hypotheses, so 2026 producing more AI\u2011driven scientific insights is credible though usually requiring human validation and robust workflows. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8349178/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12258?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Humanoid/general\u2011purpose robots performing a wide range of reliable real\u2011world tasks by 2027 is much more uncertain: industry claims (e.g., Tesla Optimus) are optimistic, while robotics experts point to persistent hardware, dexterity, energy and robustness gaps. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/23/elon-musk-on-robotaxi-optimus-tariffs-energy-and-teslas-future.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [technologyreview.com](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/27/1103035/a-skeptics-guide-to-humanoid-robot-videos/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Broad societal and economic shifts by the 2030s are widely projected (e.g., McKinsey/PwC economic impact studies), but magnitude/timing depend on deployment, regulation, and integration challenges.
