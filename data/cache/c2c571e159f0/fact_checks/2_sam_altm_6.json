  "claim": "Three economic observations underpin rapid AI impact: model intelligence scales roughly with the log of resources (compute, data, inference), the cost to use a given level of AI has been falling ~10x per year (driving vastly more use), and linear increases in intelligence produce super\u2011exponential socioeconomic value, so continued heavy investment is likely.",
  "veracity": 65,
  "explanation": "This bundle of claims is a mix of well\u2011grounded empirical regularities and stronger, more speculative inferences. Sam Altman articulated the three observations in his \u2018Three Observations\u2019 blog post (the claim\u2019s source). ([blog.samaltman.com](https://blog.samaltman.com/three-observations?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Empirically, neural \u201cscaling laws\u201d show model performance improves predictably with more compute/data (power\u2011laws that appear linear when plotted against log(resources)), so Altman\u2019s qualitative log\u2011style description is a reasonable shorthand for those findings. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) There is clear, documented evidence that per\u2011token inference prices for some frontier models (notably OpenAI\u2019s) fell by orders of magnitude in 2023\u201324 \u2014 supporting the \u2018\u2018~10x/yr\u2019\u2019 characterization as an observed trend for some providers \u2014 but this is provider/model\u2011specific, episodic, and may not hold universally (and providers also report rising backend/inference pressures for heavy users). ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/inference-whales-threaten-ai-coding-startups-business-model-2025-8?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Finally, the claim that linear IQ increases yield \u2018\u2018super\u2011exponential\u2019\u2019 socioeconomic value is plausible in many growth/AGI models (and several papers argue explosive growth is possible) but is theoretical and heavily debated by economists; empirical confirmation is lacking and outcomes depend on many constraints (energy, data, regulation, adoption). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11690?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [imf.org](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/12/Macroeconomics-of-artificial-intelligence-Brynjolfsson-Unger?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Overall: the first two observations are rooted in real, documented patterns (but simplified and not universally guaranteed); the third is a plausible but unsettled economic hypothesis \u2014 hence a moderate\u2011high veracity score rather than near\u2011certain.",
