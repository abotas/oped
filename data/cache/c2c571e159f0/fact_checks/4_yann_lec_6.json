  "claim": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is highly sample-inefficient and should not be the primary route to general intelligence; the recommended pipeline is to learn rich representations and world models via self-supervision from observation, use model-predictive control and planning at inference time, and apply RL sparingly to adjust the model or objective when predictions fail or objectives are mis-specified.",
  "veracity": 80,
  "explanation": "Mostly true. Empirically, model-free RL is well-documented as sample\u2011inefficient and motivates model-based / planning alternatives. Surveys and benchmark studies highlight high sample complexity and the data\u2011efficiency advantages of model-based or planning approaches. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16712?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Evidence shows that learning rich representations and latent/world models (often via self\u2011supervised or pretraining methods) and using planning / MPC at inference can greatly improve data efficiency (PlaNet, Dreamer and follow-up pretraining-for-RL work). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04551?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) In practice many teams adopt a pipeline of large\u2011scale representation pretraining plus limited RL fine\u2011tuning (e.g., RL from human feedback used to adjust objectives after supervised/pretraining phases). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) However, the normative claim that RL \u201cshould not be the primary route\u201d to general intelligence is debated: important groups continue to pursue RL\u2011centric or hybrid strategies (e.g., MuZero, generalist agents like Gato), so this is a well\u2011supported recommendation among many researchers but not a definitive consensus.
