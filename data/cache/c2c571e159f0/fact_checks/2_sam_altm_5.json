  "claim": "Solving the alignment problem\u2014robustly ensuring AI systems learn and act toward what we collectively really want over the long term\u2014is a prerequisite, followed by making superintelligence cheap, widely available, and not overly concentrated in the hands of a single person, company, or country.",
  "veracity": 70,
  "explanation": "Partly true: leading AI labs, safety researchers, and advocacy groups widely argue that robustly solving alignment (or at least making major progress and having verifiable safety cases) should precede deploying much more capable or potentially superintelligent systems. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-superalignment/?hss_channel=lcp-52595&utm_source=chatgpt.com), [deepmind.google](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/updating-the-frontier-safety-framework/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [futureoflife.org](https://futureoflife.org/our-position-on-ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) There is also strong, independent policy and academic concern about concentration of AI power and calls to avoid oligopoly control of transformative systems. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/11/uk-has-real-concerns-about-ai-risks-says-competition-regulator?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [openmarketsinstitute.org](https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/publications/report-ai-in-the-public-interest-confronting-the-monopoly-threat?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) However, the second half of the claim \u2014 that one should then make superintelligence \"cheap, widely available, and not overly concentrated\" \u2014 is contested and not an established fact: many experts note that wide, low-cost availability can improve transparency and competition but also increases risks of misuse or of stripping safety fine\u2011tuning (see BadLlama and other analyses), so whether broad, cheap distribution is the correct policy after alignment is debated and context\u2011dependent. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00117?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Overall, the proposition captures a widely\u2011endorsed priority (alignment first) but bundles a disputed policy prescription about cheap/widespread availability, so it is only partially verifiable.",
