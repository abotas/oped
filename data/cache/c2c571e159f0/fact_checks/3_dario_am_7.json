  "claim": "Policy and organizational steps that would substantially improve safety and the chance of a positive outcome include massively scaling interpretability research across companies and academia, requiring transparency about safety practices (Responsible Scaling Policy disclosures), and using targeted export controls (e.g., on chips to China) to buy time and strategic advantage so interpretability and other mitigations can mature before the most powerful AI is widely available.",
  "veracity": 70,
  "explanation": "This claim is broadly plausible and partially supported by expert literature and recent practice, but it is uncertain and conditional. Mechanistic/interpretability research is widely recommended as a key route to understanding and controlling advanced models (prominent reviews document benefits and hard scalability challenges). ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14082?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Major labs are already adopting \u201cResponsible Scaling\u201d\u2013style disclosure and governance frameworks (e.g., Anthropic\u2019s RSP) that aim to make safety practices and thresholds more transparent. ([anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Independent researchers and policy proposals likewise recommend registries and mandatory pre/post\u2011mitigation safety reporting to give regulators the evidentiary basis to act. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17388?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [oecd.org](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/ai-principles.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Targeted export controls on AI-relevant chips have demonstrably slowed some capability diffusion and can buy time, but analyses show these controls are leaky, impose costs, and incentivise counter\u2011measures (so their benefit depends on enforcement, allied coordination, and complementary policies). ([csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/limits-chip-export-controls-meeting-china-challenge?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) In short: scaling interpretability, truthful disclosures, and (carefully designed) export controls would likely substantially improve safety relative to doing none, but the magnitude of improvement is uncertain and hinges on scale, international coordination, enforcement, and parallel technical progress \u2014 hence a cautious, above\u2011average score (70/100).",
