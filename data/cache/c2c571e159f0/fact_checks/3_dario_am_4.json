  "claim": "Powerful AI will not automatically favor democracy, peace, or equitable access; AI is a dual-use technology that can strengthen both democracies and authoritarian regimes through surveillance, propaganda, and economic/military advantage, so democracies must proactively coordinate (an 'entente strategy'), secure supply chains (e.g., chip export controls), scale responsibly, and offer benefits to other countries to avoid empowering autocracies and to tilt global governance toward liberal democracy.",
  "veracity": 93,
  "explanation": "Highly accurate. Empirical evidence shows powerful AI is \u2018\u2018dual\u2011use\u2019\u2019\u2014it can amplify surveillance, censorship, and disinformation (thereby strengthening authoritarian control) as well as boost democratic governance and economic/military power. Human Rights Watch documents AI-driven mass surveillance in Xinjiang, and Freedom House documents how generative AI supercharges censorship and disinformation campaigns\u2014supporting the claim that AI does not automatically favor democracy, peace, or equitable access. ([hrw.org](https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/05/01/chinas-algorithms-repression/reverse-engineering-xinjiang-police-mass?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [freedomhouse.org](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2023/repressive-power-artificial-intelligence?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  Governments already use supply\u2011chain and export controls on advanced chips to limit hostile military/AI build\u2011up (U.S. BIS actions), showing that \u201csecure supply chains / chip export controls\u201d are real policy levers. ([bis.gov](https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-strengthens-export-controls-restrict-chinas-capability-produce-advanced-semiconductors-military?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  International bodies and policy analysts likewise recommend allied coordination, responsible scaling, and capacity\u2011building (OECD AI Principles; UN/High\u2011Level advisory proposals and calls for a global AI fund and capacity\u2011building for developing countries), supporting the prescription that democracies should coordinate, scale responsibly, and share benefits. ([oecd.org](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/ai-principles.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/19/global-ai-fund-needed-to-help-developing-nations-tap-tech-benefits-un-says?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  The remaining uncertainty (why score <100) is normative and predictive: while evidence strongly supports the dual\u2011use risk and policy responses, outcomes depend on future political choices and implementation details; thus the claim is very well supported but not certain to be realized in every scenario.",
