  "claim": "Although malicious actors will misuse AI, the net societal impact is likely to be positive worldwide: most people will employ AI to learn, innovate, and achieve advances (including medical breakthroughs), and its limitations will ultimately push humans to focus more on distinctively human pursuits such as caregiving, teamwork, deep reading, creative exploration, and spiritual growth.",

  "explanation": "Parts of the claim are plausible\u2014AI has already enabled scientific advances such as DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold\u20113 for biomolecular interactions and AI\u2011designed drugs reaching Phase II trials\u2014but the broader prediction remains speculative.
