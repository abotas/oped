  "claim": "As of 2023\u20132024, early evidence suggests AI increases productivity and broadens access to expertise globally (e.g., consultants achieved about 40% higher-quality outputs on diverse tasks; AI can serve as an effective tutor and language aid), with disproportionately larger gains for less-skilled or underserved users, potentially reducing inequality.",
  "veracity": 88,
  "explanation": "Overall, the claim is well\u2011supported by early (2023\u20132024) evidence. Randomized field experiments show sizable performance gains and some narrowing of performance gaps: BCG\u2019s study with 758 consultants reported ~40% higher\u2011quality outputs on tasks within the model\u2019s competence; Noy & Zhang\u2019s Science RCT found 40% faster completion and 18% higher\u2011quality writing with larger gains for lower\u2011skill participants; and a large workplace rollout of an AI assistant for 5,000+ customer support agents raised productivity 14% on average and 34% for novices.
