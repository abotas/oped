  "claim": "Globally, advanced AI is poised to transform society primarily by (a) accelerating technological progress through automating research, (b) introducing artificial agents and AI\u2011integrated institutions as key decision\u2011makers, and (c) making durable centralization of power far easier\u2014changes that could unfold quickly as capabilities scale.",

  "explanation": "Largely plausible but partly speculative. (a) There is strong evidence that AI already accelerates parts of scientific discovery and engineering (e.g., AlphaFold\u2019s reshaping of structural biology; autonomous labs and AI\u2011guided materials discovery), though large\u2011scale validation and synthesis remain bottlenecks.

Thus, AI\u2011integrated institutions as key decision\u2011makers are emerging but not yet widespread.

([oecd.org](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2024/05/artificial-intelligence-data-and-competition_9d0ac766.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21015?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [brookings.edu](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/market-concentration-implications-of-foundation-models-the-invisible-hand-of-chatgpt/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Finally, scaling trends and recent data show capabilities and deployment can change quickly as compute scales and costs fall, making rapid societal effects plausible.
