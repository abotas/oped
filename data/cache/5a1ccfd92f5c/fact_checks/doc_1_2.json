  "claim": "If developed and deployed in time, AI itself can provide the capabilities needed for safe governance\u2014substantially improving forecasting, information navigation, bargaining/commitment, coordination, and democratic deliberation/oversight\u2014thereby enabling more affluent, stable, and cooperative global politics (\"world peace without world government\").",

  "explanation": "This sweeping claim is largely speculative. There is some early evidence that AI can assist specific governance-relevant tasks\u2014e.g., LLM assistants can improve human forecasting accuracy, and AI mediation can help small groups find common ground\u2014but these findings come from controlled settings and do not show system-level political effects; moreover, AI-only forecasters generally underperform top human crowds. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07862?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [technologyreview.com](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/17/1105810/ai-could-help-people-find-common-ground-during-deliberations/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) AI negotiation agents demonstrate language-enabled bargaining (e.g., Cicero in Diplomacy), yet analyses find limits in real persuasion and cooperation, underscoring the gap to real-world governance. ([science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.ade9097?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04643?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) At the same time, high-quality assessments warn that generative AI is already amplifying disinformation and digital repression, and major policy analyses flag plausible pathways by which AI could destabilize strategic stability (including nuclear deterrence).
