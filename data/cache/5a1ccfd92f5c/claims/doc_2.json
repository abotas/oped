It\u2019s probably going to be a fantastic tutor, that will transform education and help humans all around the world learn more.

Peter Thiel recently told the podcast host Tyler Cowen that he believed A.I. would be worse for math people than it would be for word people, because the technology was getting a lot better at solving math problems than verbal exercises.\n\nIt may also make the world more equal.

If you are an immigrant trying to write in a new language, A.I. takes your abilities up to average. It will probably make us vastly more productive and wealthier.
